Hey there 

Iâ€™m Kurt, a second year Development and UX Desig student at The Open Window. I play a lot of board games and tabletop games and that comes through in my projects. I make it a goal to make each project look and feel different from each other, since I want to focus on front-end and UI, it makes sense to have a diverse set of skills.
